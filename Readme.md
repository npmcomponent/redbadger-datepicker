## How to use

This is a component component. You can easily plug it into your site or web app. Check the example of usage in test/index.html. To get things working, follow these easy steps (assuming you already have Node.js and npm installed):

* `npm install -g component`
* Clone this repository and navigate into the component folder
* Run `component install` to fetch dependencies
* Run `component build`
* Now you can open test/index.html and if everything is fine you should be able to see the component in action

If your app already uses components, you can simply run `component install redbadger/datepicker` - this will fetch and install all dependencies into /components folder of your project.

## Features

*  Takes and returns a value of type `Date`
*  Hide on click outside
*  Manual date change support
*  Keyboard interaction
*  Fully configurable date format with custom divider symbols

## Example

``` javascript
var Datepicker = require('datepicker');

var picker = Datepicker(document.getElementById('date'), "DD/MM/YYYY")

picker.value(new Date());
picker.value() // => currently selected date as a Date instance

```

## Custom date format

You can specify the format of the date you expect it to produce. Format is a string, which can be something like this:

*  "DD/MM/YYYY"
*  "YYYY-MM-DD"
*  "mm.dd.yy"

Order of month, day and year will be recognized by the component, divider symbol will also be honored. You can ask for 2 digit year or 4 with "YY" or "YYYY" respectably.
